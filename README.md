Heart Disease Classification

Overview

This project focuses on building an end-to-end machine learning model to classify heart disease presence in patients based on various health metrics. The dataset used is the heart-disease.csv, and the project is implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
Model Building: Training multiple models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC for model performance evaluation.
Visualization: Plotting feature importance and other visual insights

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is heart-disease.csv, containing various patient health metrics.

Installation

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/kuruash/Heart-Disease-Classification.git
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Place the dataset (heart-disease.csv) in the project directory.
Run the Jupyter notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb
Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, build models, and evaluate results.

Results
